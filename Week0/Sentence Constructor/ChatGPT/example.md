<ME> benus dias como estas


<ChatGPT>
Almost there! A couple of small corrections:

What You Actually Said:
"Benus dias, how are you?" (with a typo in "buenos")

Corrections:
"Benus" should be "Buenos."
"Dias" should be "dÃ­as" (with an accent).
Final Hint:
The correct phrase starts with Buenos dÃ­as (Good morning), followed by what you already got right: Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?

Now, try again! ğŸš€

Almost! Just fix the small typo in "Benus" â†’ Buenos

Correct Sentence:
ğŸ‘‰ Buenos dÃ­as, Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s?

You're doing great! Now, try translating this:
"Good afternoon, how are you?"

(Hint: "Good afternoon" in Spanish is "Buenas tardes") ğŸ˜‰






You said:
benus  < not sure name> Como estas

You're doing well! Just a small fix in "Benus" â†’ Buenos and now you need the correct phrase for "Good afternoon."

Hint:
"Good afternoon" in Spanish is "Buenas tardes."
The rest of your sentence "Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?" is already correct!
Now, put it together and try again! ğŸš€
