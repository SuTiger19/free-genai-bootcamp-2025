## Functional Requirements  
The company wants to implement GenAI on-premises but plans to train and test the model on the cloud before investing in hardware due to high costs. The primary reason for an on-premises solution is privacy concerns regarding user data. However, hardware acquisition will only take place once the model is fully developed and ready.  

Currently, the company is allocating $5,000 for cloud resources to develop and showcase a functional GenAI product. Once the product is validated, they plan to invest $20,000 in AI hardware for on-premises deployment.  

There are approximately 300 active students interested in participating in this program. The events and implementation will take place in Mexico.

## Assumptions  

- The focus is on open-source LLMs, which will be temporarily trained and deployed on a major cloud provider before transitioning to an on-premises setup.  
- The final hardware setup, costing around $15,000, should be powerful enough to support student learning and accelerate their progress.  
- The model is designed to assist students, not replace teachers, by offering on-demand learning support tailored to their individual schedules.

## Data Strategy  

- All copyrighted educational materials will be legally purchased from authorized sources and stored in a secured database.  
- Content guardrails must be established to define proper usage scope, ensuring the model is appropriate for students of all ages.

## Considerations  

- We can explore models like DeepSeek, an open-source LLM that delivers performance comparable to premium models like ChatGPT.  
- Alternatively, we should consider open-source models with traceable training data to avoid potential legal or ethical issues in the future.
